      Hi, my name is Chris. I’m a product focused web developer, creative thinker and problem solver. <span class="bold">I help businesses extend their product to the web through tailored platforms vital to reaching a digitally-minded world.</span>

      Working closely with clients, I analyze the specific needs of a project and devise innovative solutions through web technologies. I believe strongly in UX — the user’s needs must inform the composition of the end product to create a symbiotic relationship between form and function. With this in mind, I take on a limited number of projects to ensure precise attention to detail and development velocity.
